            <p>The portfolio of LA-based illustrator Xoana Herrera is an explosion of sumptuous, stylish character
                scenes dwelling in a world that, frankly, looks ideal. Xoana trained as a graphic designer in Argentina
                but over time found herself drawn to the world of illustration after a five-year stint at Buck agency.

            <p>Now, alongside founding a feminist creative collective, Get it Girl, she creates graceful, complex and
                accessible imagery which would be as at home in an ad campaign as it would be in a children’s book
                (which she's quite keen to try soon). “As an artist I think it is up to us to keep evolving and taking
                creative decisions,” she says. “Aiming to be innovative is something I feel I can dare to try every time
                I take a job, and that’s amazing.”</p>
