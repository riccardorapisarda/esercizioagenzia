            <p>La Boca have the rare, impressive ability to create designs and artwork resembling some of the best album
                sleeves lurking in your dad’s record collection. The studio, founded in 2002, is based in west London
                and has gathered an envious collection of awards, including Cannes Lions, European Design Awards, and
                the AOI Illustration Awards.</p>

            <p> “We work as a studio, so most of our designs are created as a team,” says Scott Bendall of La Boca.
                “It's not unusual to have two or three people working on a single piece.” Keen to work on more animated
                projects in the future, the team (based in two studios, one in London and one in Amsterdam) are never
                short on work from a selection of devoted clients. In their own words, La Boca’s creations are: “Retina
                teasing, tactile and occasionally slightly wonky.”</p>
