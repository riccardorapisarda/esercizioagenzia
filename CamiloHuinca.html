            <p>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for
                itself. Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic design and
                painting. Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on
                the use of curiosity,” he explains. In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on graphic
                design projects in “a more commercial way”.</p>

            <p>However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a
                communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours. I am interested in
                identifying people’s behaviour, portraying activities, intimate moments, body gestures, disfiguring
                objects and reducing the amount of detail in a composition.”</p>
