            <p>Swedish illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz lives and works in London where she creates
                charmingly clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and
                commercial clients. Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at Hyper Island, a time which
                Linn cites as “hands down one of the best experiences” of her life.</p>

            <p>As she puts it, “There’s more freedom drawing digitally, and more room for mistakes.” Alongside her
                editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a community of equality-driven
                women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect and support each other within the animation
                industry.” Some of her favorite projects often orbit around her interests of “feminism, clothes, plants
                and interior”.</p>
